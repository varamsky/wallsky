Wallsky, pronounced as wallski.<br><br>
A Wallpaper app made with Flutter.

## !!How to Use it!! : 
- Obtain your own API keys from Pexels, Unpslash and Pixabay.
- Create a file named apiKeys.dart in your lib/ folder having something like this,

<br>

```
List<String> apiKeyList = [  
	//'PUT YOUR PEXELS_API_KEY HERE',
	//'PUT YOUR UNSPLASH_API_KEY HERE',
	//'PUT YOUR PIXABAY_API_KEY HERE',
];
```

 <br>
 this is also shown in the /lib/screens/homeScreen.dart as a comment.
 
 - !!PAY ATTENTIOON!! If you don't follow the previous instructions then the app won't work!!!
 - The import statement for the apiKeys.dart file is already included in /lib/screens/homeScreen.dart
 - After this you are good to go.
